Preface

This hand-book of Africa, which is entitled "African Almanac" is the first of its kind to be published in Ethiopia.

Even though it does not contain all details and particulars as "World Almanacs" do, it is believed that the future publications of this "African Almanac" would be complete and detailed, in the proper sense of the word "Almanac."

This year, seventeen African countries have achieved their independence. That is why the year 1960 came to be known as the "African year." 

For the same reason, there is no doubt that the year "1960" should be given a special importance in the history of Africa. 

Thus, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, a staunch supporter of African freedom, has ordered that this first "African Almanac" should be prepared as an expression of His deep satisfaction during this "African year," and dedicates the book in honour of the new African Independent countries and of those who are struggling for their independence.

	Its boundaries are: in the north, the Republic of Sudan and the Red Sea, in the south, Kenya and the Somali Republic, in the east, French Somaliland and the Somali Republic, and in the west, the Republic of Sudan.	 

Area: 		450,000 sq. miles.

The present Chamber consists of 210 Deputies.  

The members of the Senate are appointed by the Emperor. The number of Senators does not exceed one-half of the total number of Deputies. 

All laws are approved by the Parliament and ratified by the Emperor. 

Ruler: 		H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I. 

His Imperial Majesty, descendant of the oldest and longest royal line in recorded history, ascended the throne on November 2, 1930, with the title of 'Hail Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia.' 

Born on July 23, 1892, at Ejersa Goro, Harar Province, Emperor Haile Selassie is the great grandson of King Sahle Selassie who was a descendant of King Solomon and Queen of Sheba. His father His Highness Ras Makonnen, a hero of the famous battle of Adwa, in 1896, was Emperor Menelik's trusted diplomat and a general of great valour. Upon the completion of His education, during the early years of His age, Emperor Haile Selassie was called upon to serve His country in many outstanding posts, before He, finally became the leader of the country. 

He led Ethiopia to become a member of the League of Nations in 1923. 

Seven months after his coronation on November 2, 1930. Emperor Haile Selassie, He, of his own volition, graciously decreed the first written constitution and Parliament in the history of Ethiopia, making himself a constitutional monarch.

In 1935, the Italian Fascists launched their aggression against Ethiopia, and in June 1936 Emperor Haile Selasie, before the League of Nations at Geneva, personally pleaded the cause of his country and coincidentally that of international morality. Although the League of Nations put up a deaf ear to his country and coincidentally that of international morality. Although the League of Nations put up a deaf ear to his historic appeal, Emperor Haile Selassie never lost confidence. It was primarily through his wise judgment and astute statesmanship that the day of liberation came, when on May 5, 1941, five years after the Fascist invasion, He rode triumphantly back into the capital of his Empire, at the head of his conquering patriots, with the help of the British troops. 

Since the liberation, both in internal and external affairs, His Imperial Majesty has proved to be the dynamic architect of Modern Ethiopia. Upon his return, He found the country in a war-torn condition, ad soon He embarked on a huge programme to give life to the nation. He opened new schools, built modern hospitals, constructed new roads and improved communication facilities. On November 2, 1955, on the day of His Silver Jubilee Coronation anniversary, He of His own will, once again gave a new revised constitution, thereby, granting the country a general election of the basis of universal adult suffrage. Freedom of press and speech is also granted in the constitution. 

A staunch supporter of the U.N., Emperor Haile Selassie, inaugurating the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, said, "The United Nations is a living and tangible testimony to the value of cooperative efforts among all men to improve their way of life and preserve peace." Above all, He has committed Himself to the preservation of two principle - "Collective Security" and "independence for oppressed peoples." 

A supporter of African Nationalism, Emperor Hail Selassie welcomes and entertains, at his court, many African Nationalists, with whom He exchanges ideas. He has devoted Himself to the cause of African freedom, ever since be returned from Britain in 1941, where be went on exile, seeking outside help against the fascist aggression in His country. 

Speaking of African independence, on November 2, 1958, on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of His Coronation, He said, "Time has demonstrated that those Africans, who believed that the existence of an independent Ethiopia would open the door to freedom for all of Africa, were not mistaken in their beliefs. The family of independent nations in Africa is today growing apace, and no power on earth can now arrest this process." 

Economic

Development: 	Ethiopia is mainly an agricultural country. Due to the fertility of most of the country, many of its regions yield two crops a year. The chief crops are maiz, wheat, barley, rye, cotton, sugar-cane, millet, hemp, teff (the common bread grain), and coffee. Ethiopia has embarked on a plan to set up industries which produce domestic necessities. It exports coffee, hides and skins, cereals, oil seeds, meat, gold and platinum. Ethiopia imports textiles, iron, steel, machinery, motor vehicles, agricultural machinery and tractors, pharmaceutical and petroleum products. Monetary unit: Ethiopian Dollar. 

Religion:		Mainly Christian (Official Religion) and a number of Moslems.  

Defence: 	Ethiopia has re-organized her armed forces into three parts. The ground force comprises the Army and the Imperial Body Guard. The Air Force in will organized and equipped with jet fighter-bombers. Though, the navy is still young, it has shown on active progress to be developed. In addition to these, the Territorial Army is being established. Projects are underway towards the expansion of the defence system which is controlled by the Ministry of National Defense. 





LIBERIA

Geographical

Situation:	The State was proclaimed an independent Republic on July 26, 1847. Liberia is situated in West Africa, and is bounded in the north by Guinea and Ivory Coast, in the west by Sierra Leone, in the south by the Atlantic, and in the east by Ivory Coast.  

Area: 		43,000 sq. miles. 

Population:	2,500,000.

Capital:	MONROVIA, other important towns are: Marshall, Harper and Bachanan. 

Language: 	Official in English, tribal dialects are also spoken. 

Government: 	Republic.  

The Constitution of Liberia is similar to that of U.S.A. The Legislative power consists of two separate branches: the Senate and the House of Representatives, which together form the "Legislature.' Members of the House of Representatives and Senators are elected by a universal suffrage for a period of four and six years respectively. The executive power is vested on a President, elected for a period of eight years, after which he may be re-elected for a term of four years, as many times as the people wish to elect him. 

Head of State: 	 President William V (acanarat) S (hadrach) Tubman. "the Maker of Modern Liberia." took office as President at the beginning of 1944  and has stayed on ever since. 

Though his True Whig party has ruled the country since 1870, President Tubman's triumph is counted in Liberia as something very personal. 

Liberia, was settled in 1822 by freedom seeking Americans of African origin from 27 American states, the colonization societies being motivated by a great desire to found a Christian nation in Africa. 

President Tubman's aim from the beginning has been to weld the many different racial groups into one homogeneous nation. He has traveled extensively in the backwoods (the first president to do so), has given these people the vote and is encouraging them to take a more important part in public life and in the government.  

Economically, his hope has been to cram into his 16 years of office "a hundred years of progress and modernization," concentrating on health, public welfare, education, road building and the development of industry, commerce and natural resources. He facilitates concessions to foreign firms whenever they are going to be a benefit to Liberia as well. Industrial undertakings begun under his regime, have transformed great untried areas and galvanized the people into taking a more direct interest in world affairs.  

President Tubman, who was born on November 29, 1895, descended from settlers, in known among his people as "Bodor Shad" (Brother Shadrach). Unanimous votes in his favour on big occasions in this one-party country are often described in the Liberian press and "expressions of a nation's gratitude." 

Economic

Development: 	The Agricultural and Industrial potential of the country is being extended. Principal exports are crude rubber, iron ore, raw gold, piassava palm, kernels, palm oil and small quantities of cocas & coffee. Diamonds are also exported.

Monitary unit: Dollar. 

Religion:		Christians (Official) with Moslems & Animists.  

Defence: 		Liberia's army of about 4,000 men is organized on militia basis. 





UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA 

		Geographical

Situation:	The Union of South Africa which came into being on May 31, 1910, is g97hded in the south by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, in the west by the Atlantic and South West Africa. In the north by Bechuanaland and Southern Rhodesia, and in the cast by the Indian Ocean. .  

		Area: 		472,359 sq. miles. 

		Population:	14,418,000 (of which 3 millions are Europeans).

		Capital:	Pretorin and Cape-toun. Other big towns and Johannesburg. Durban. Port Elizabeth, East London and Kimberly.  

		Language: 	Official - English and Afrikaans. The natives speak Bantu dialects. 

		Government: 	The governor general represents the Queen of United Kingdom, who is sovereign also over the Union of South Africa. But, in October of this year, a referendum which was voted only by the white population was held to change the status of the Union into a Republic, which will be declared on May 31, 1961. The prime Minister is more powerful and has almost a dictatorial authority. The government of South Africa is entirely dominated by the European population, mainly composed of Boers (Dutch originated South African whites) and English descendants. The original South African constitution does not guarantee the white supremacy over the colourd people, which the present rulers of the country practice as their main policy. This policy of apartheid is rejected by the coloured people who as a result staged political demonstrations several times: and in March 1960 a brutal massacre of innocent natives was done by fascist whites and militant rulers of the Union. This brutal action was condemned by all peoples of the world. 

There are two African Political parties behind the massive resistance against apartheid. These African parties are: 

1:  The Pan African people's Congress 

2:   African National Congress. 

		Head of Government: 	Dr. Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd, 59-year-old Prime Minister of South Africa, is the chief advocate of Apartheid, by which is meant the strict segregation of the 3,000,000 white and 11,000,000 black people of the Union. 

To the rest of the world and to the basic principles of human freedom and equality, apartheid becomes inacceptable, but to him (to Dr. Verwoerd), apartheid is designed "for happiness, security and stability, by providing the Bento, as well as the whites, with their own home, language and administration."

He believes it will bring "peaceful co-existence and justice to all people in our beloved Homeland." 

South Africa is not, in fact, Dr. Verwoerd's homeland. He was born in Amsterdam of Dutch parents, but the family settled in the Union when be was still a baby. 

His early career was spent as a Professor of Applied Psychology, and of Sociology and Social Work at Stellen-bosch University (1927-39). His introduction to politics came through his editorship of the Nationalist party newspaper Die Transyaler (1937-48).

He entered the South African Parliament as a Senator in 1948, and two years later became Minister for Native Affairs. 

For eight years be devoted himself to a series of measures enforcing Apartheid, over-riding hostility from the Africans, from Churches, and from some politicians and businessmen.

As Premier, Dr. Verwoerd has worked to speed the day when his country will become a Republic, a policy now endorsed by a referendum. 

By this step, like his "Bantustan" segretation laws, be seea as a move to preserve "This frontier outpost in the Dark Continent." 

Dr. Verwoerd was shot twice in the head while opening a trade fair at Johannesburg in April, 1960.

Three months later, fully recovered, he said: "We believe we were spared by a Higher Hand, not for our selves but to render a service to the people and to the Fatherland." 

		Economic

Development: 	The Union of South Africa is well developed agriculturally and commercially. It is the largest producer as well as consumer of necessary materials, in the whole continent of Africa. Its gross national income is the highest in the continent, followed by that of Nigeria and the former Belgian territory of Congo. The Union exports iron, gold, diamonds, uranium, coal, wool, meat, fruits and other items. It imports industrial machinery, motor vehicles, pharmaceutical products, petroleum products, consumer goods, furnitares and textiles.   

Currency: South African Pound. 

		Religion:	Christian & Animist.  

		Defence: 	South African has its own Air Force and Navy. Its army is well organized. The Ministry of Defence is in charge of these forces.
